I am going to earn 10K per month and won't stop until I reach this goal. No matter how many years it take to reach this number, no matter how many rejections I have to face, I will never stop. Even before reaching this number, I would have already achieved financial freedom but I still won't stop because I love writing code and building things. Even if I don't reach this number, I would still build things forever until my last breadth.

All my experiments are going to be my legacy and would help the builders forever. Even if nobody uses my creations, it doesn't matter. I loved every moment while building them.


If you are reading this then either I have achieved my goal or someone found this very first commit after my death. I hope you will also dedicate your life to the craft you love. 

It may sound like I am money hungry(I am a bit) but the money reflects the value I am able to create for others. 

I don't expect people to remember my name but hope they believe in the idea of lifelong learning and giving their life for something bigger than them.

I am vishesh, the lifelong builder. 
Peace

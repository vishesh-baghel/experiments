# Sensie - Your AI Learning Sensei

## Vision

Sensie is a hyper-personalized AI learning agent that teaches you deeply through Socratic questioning, identifies knowledge gaps, and adapts to your learning pace. Unlike generic AI tutors, Sensie maintains a persistent understanding of your learning journey, employs proven pedagogical techniques (spaced repetition, Feynman technique), and can teach from any source: documentation, codebases, articles, or user-provided materials.

**Core Philosophy:** "True mastery comes not from being told, but from discovering through guided questioning."

## Tagline

"Your training begins now, young apprentice"

## Core Value Proposition

Traditional learning tools give you answers. Sensie makes you earn understanding.

**The Sensie Difference:**
- **Deep Questioning:** Won't let you move forward until you can answer probing questions about the concept
- **Gap Detection:** Identifies weak foundations and teaches prerequisites before advanced topics
- **Socratic Method:** Guides you to answers through questions, not explanations
- **Multi-Source Learning:** Learn from docs, code, articles, or your own materials
- **Persistent Memory:** Remembers your entire learning journey, adapts difficulty as you grow
- **Spaced Repetition:** Automatically reminds you to review topics before you forget
- **Master Roshi Personality:** Learning is serious, but the journey should be fun

## Target User

**Primary:** Software engineers who want to deeply understand new technologies, not just copy-paste solutions

**Characteristics:**
- Committed to genuine mastery, not surface-level knowledge
- Willing to be challenged and questioned
- Prefers understanding "why" over memorizing "what"
- Learning complex technical topics (Rust, system design, distributed systems, etc.)
- Uses ChatGPT/Claude but frustrated by shallow explanations
- Wants structured learning without rigid course formats

## Topic Scope

**Supported Topics:** Technical Skills + Human Skills

Sensie is designed for holistic professional growth. Most of your time is spent working with people, not just code.

### Technical Skills
- **Programming:** Languages (Rust, Go, TypeScript), frameworks, algorithms, data structures
- **System Design:** Architecture patterns, distributed systems, databases, scalability
- **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Cloud architecture, CI/CD, security, observability
- **Engineering Practices:** Code review, debugging, testing strategies, technical writing

### Human & Soft Skills
- **Communication:** Giving/receiving feedback, explaining technical concepts to non-technical people, written communication, public speaking, active listening
- **Teamwork:** Collaboration, conflict resolution, working across time zones, pair programming dynamics, building trust with teammates
- **Relationships:** Managing up (working with your manager), peer relationships, mentoring others, building professional networks
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Self-awareness, empathy, handling stress, dealing with difficult conversations, receiving criticism gracefully
- **Leadership:** Influencing without authority, decision-making, running effective meetings, delegation, creating psychological safety

### Career & Professional Growth
- **Technical Interviewing:** System design interviews, coding interviews, behavioral questions
- **Career Development:** Building a portfolio, open source contribution, personal branding, negotiation
- **Productivity:** Time management, focus, prioritization, learning how to learn

### Why Soft Skills Belong in Sensie

The Socratic method originated in philosophy, not programming. It excels at:
- Questioning assumptions about interpersonal dynamics
- Exploring "why did that conversation go wrong?"
- Testing understanding of human behavior
- Building frameworks for complex social situations

Soft skills are **skills** - they can be learned, practiced, and mastered just like programming.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Socratic Teaching Method
Other AI tools: "Here's the answer to your question."
Sensie: "What do you think happens here? Why? What if we change X?"

### 2. Depth-First Learning
Other AI tools: Surface coverage of many topics
Sensie: Won't let you proceed until you master current concept

### 3. Codebase-Aware Learning
Other AI tools: Generic code examples
Sensie: "Let's learn Rust by exploring the Tokio runtime codebase"

### 4. Persistent Progress Tracking
Other AI tools: Every conversation starts fresh
Sensie: Knows what you learned 3 weeks ago and tests retention

### 5. Adaptive Difficulty
Other AI tools: Same explanation depth for everyone
Sensie: Adjusts complexity based on your answers and progress

## Primary User Flows

### Flow 1: Starting a New Learning Topic

1. **Initiate Learning**
   - User: "Teach me Rust ownership"
   - Sensie analyzes the topic and creates a structured learning path

2. **Learning Path Preview (Sensie Controls the Path)**
   - Sensie: "Excellent choice, young apprentice! I've mapped out your training journey:"
   - Presents the learning path (view-only, not editable):
     - Memory Addresses (foundation)
     - Stack vs Heap (foundation)
     - Ownership Basics
     - Move Semantics
     - Borrowing
     - Lifetimes
   - User can optionally share their goal: "I want to learn this for building CLI tools"

## Visitor Mode Experience

**Philosophy:** Complete authenticity. No fake demos, no curated showcases.

The goal of visitor mode across all agents (Sensie, Jack, etc.) is the same: **show real usage, not marketing material**. Visitors see exactly what I'm learning, where I'm struggling, and how I'm progressing.

**Why Authenticity:**
- Builds genuine credibility (can't fake a 75% mastery over months)
- Shows the tool is actually useful (I use it daily)
- More compelling than polished demos
- Aligns with personal brand of transparency

**What Visitors See (Everything Real):**
- Actual topics I'm learning (Rust, Giving Feedback, System Design)
- Real progress percentages and mastery levels
- Real learning path and subtopics
- Real questions I've been asked
- Real struggle points (where I needed hints)
- Full UI/UX including commands
- Master Roshi personality in action

**What's Hidden (Privacy, Not Authenticity):**
- Specific code examples from private projects
- Personal notes that reference work context
- Nothing that changes the authenticity of progress

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const isVisitor = session?.role === "visitor";

// Visitors see REAL data, just read-only
const data = isVisitor
  ? getAnonymizedLearningData() // Real topics, sanitized details
  : getRealLearningData();
```

## Integration with Ecosystem

### Jack (Content Agent)
**Context Shared:** Current learning topics
**Value:** Jack suggests content ideas based on what you're learning
**Example:** Learning Rust → Jack suggests "Thread: What I learned building a CLI in Rust"

### Code Review Agent (Future)
**Context Shared:** Skill proficiency levels
**Value:** Code review knows your expertise, provides appropriate feedback
**Example:** Beginner in Rust → More explanatory reviews vs Expert → Nitpicky reviews

### Overseer (Orchestration)
**Context Shared:** Learning schedule, topics, mastery levels
**Value:** Unified view of personal growth across all agents
**Example:** Overseer dashboard shows "30 hours learning this month, 3 topics mastered"

## Technical Foundation (High-Level)

**Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
**AI Agent:** Mastra framework (similar to Jack)
**Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma (Neon)
**LLM Gateway:** Vercel AI Gateway
**Observability:** Langfuse (track teaching effectiveness)
**Authentication:** Passphrase-based (owner) + visitor mode
**Deployment:** Vercel (free tier compatible)
